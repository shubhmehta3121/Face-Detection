# Face-Detection
1. Face Detection with OpenCV and Haar Cascade:

This Python script showcases face detection using the Haar Cascade classifier provided by OpenCV. It captures video from the default camera, detects faces in each frame, and draws rectangles around the detected faces. Additionally, it draws diagonal lines across the detected faces for visualization. The application can be exited by pressing the 'q' key.
2. Face Detection with MTCNN:

This Python code demonstrates real-time face detection using the MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) model. It captures video from the default camera, detects faces in each frame using the MTCNN detector, and draws bounding boxes around the detected faces. Users can exit the application by pressing the 'q' key.
These code snippets provide examples of face detection using different techniques, from traditional Haar Cascade classifiers to modern deep learning-based MTCNN models, allowing users to choose the method that best suits their needs for face detection applications.
